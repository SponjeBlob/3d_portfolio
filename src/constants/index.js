            "My second year of University was much more focused on game design and creation. The year was broken up into 2 modules, starting of with designing a in depth GDD. The second module was creating a game following one of the GDDs, we did these in groups. I was part of a group of 4 making a game called 'Oh Rats!' I was the character artist and animator but I also contributed towards other areas in-engine. The game turned out really well and is available to see in my projects. This year taught me the value of teamwork and communication and was a big step towards a more proffesional practice.",

This helped me understand what things i should improve on and begin to prepare myself for the work environment. Alongside the talks I have also been designing my next game 'Through Ash' which i will be making for my final major project. 'Through Ash' is a short narrative driven game where you play as a rover handler remotely controlling a rover across a nuclear wasteland. I will be updating my progress on this game, so head over to projects to have a look.",
